# Project Title: Image Inpainting - I/O Framework

## Team:
Team #2 - Daniel Yohan & Lilach Cohen

## Description:
This project focuses on image inpainting, where we developed a model to generate alternative synthesized content for missing or masked regions in images. By leveraging a pretrained model trained on the “places2” and “celebA” datasets (see Acknowledgements), our approach aims to replace “empty masks” with realistic backgrounds that seamlessly blend into the original images. For more details, please see the report.
